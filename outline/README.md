## Outline for Project

This project is a visual display of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The visuals focus on a few elements of the blockchain's history:

* The minting of new coins. The mint comes from the center, with the coins traveling as a beam of light according to their value (again, interesting to compare as USD vs BTC).

* Coins allocated to the associated wallet over time. The size on screen, and/or brightness, of the wallet will vary with the amount of value held in the wallet. May be interesting to be able to compare how that value changes when calculated solely as Bitcoin, or when calculated as USD according to inflationary value

* Transactions from one wallet to another, represented as an arced line that has a brightness that varies according to amount and may fade over time until very little trace is left

* The creation of wallets. Concentric circles expand outwards with each circle representing one year. Wallets are created around a circle in that year

To limit the scope and project intensity, and to make calculation more feasible given my available hardware, I will likely have to put a threshold on wallet size. For example, a wallet may have to hold at least $100 worth of Bitcoin at one point in time (calculating for market value over time) before 

The final result needs to be an interactive page that is viewable on my web portfolio.
